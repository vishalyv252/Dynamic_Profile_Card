# Description:

Hello everyone, I created a Dynamic profile card built using Angular and Tailwind CSS, displaying dynamic user information such as name, age, location, followers, likes, and photos. Key features include string interpolation for user details, @Input() decorator for profile image data communication, and ngFor for dynamically rendering statistics.

# Versions:

Node : 20.18.0
Angular : 18.2.7

# Note: 

I created this angular web application using standalone format. If anyone is using angular below version 14. It will not work.
